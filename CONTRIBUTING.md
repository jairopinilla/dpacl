# Contributing to DPACL

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Our Development Process

We sync our internal repository with this github repository through regularly scheduled jobs. You can expect to see the updates we make in-house here soon after.

## Pull Requests

We actively appreciate your pull requests. You should be aware that a problem should be submitted before a pull request.

The step by step

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.

## Coding Style

We are using Prettier to format our source code. The styles are enforced via eslint. Make sure everything is well formatted before creating a PR. Therefore, run `npm run pretty` to apply formatting fixes.
